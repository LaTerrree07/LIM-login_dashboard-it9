This project is a simple web app with a login page, a registration form, and a dashboard.
It lets a user create an account, log in using that account, and then view a dashboard that shows a table of student records.

The app has three main parts.
1. Login page
2. Register form
3. Dashboard page with a student list table

How to use the system
1) Create an account (Register)
If you don’t have an account yet, you can register first.

Open the login page, then click the **Register** button. A registration form will appear. Fill out the required fields, then submit the form. After registering, your account can be used to log in.

2) Log in
Go back to the login page and enter your username and password.

You can log in using the new account you registered, or an existing account if you already have one. Once the login is successful, the system will redirect you to the dashboard.

3) View the dashboard
After logging in, the dashboard page will appear.

On the dashboard, you will see a table that lists students. This table is meant to show the student list in a clear and organized way.
